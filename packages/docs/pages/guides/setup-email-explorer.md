## What is Email Explorer?

Email Explorer is a feature, that allows you and your team to see and open email received using
[Cloudflare Email routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/email-routing/).

It works by catching the emails you configure to send to your R2 Explorer instance, saving theses
in a R2 bucket and then exposing a UI built around the R2 API.


## Are there new features coming to Email Explorer?

Yes, the features planned for the near future are:

- Custom email folders
- Configure rules to send emails to specific folders (like gmail filters)
- Delete emails
- Move emails between folders
- Email Search

After having your worker updated and deployed in your Cloudflare account, head over to the Cloudflare Dash and open
the domain you want to setup.
